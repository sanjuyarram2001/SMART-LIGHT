INFO: [Labtools 27-2302] Device xc7z020 (JTAG device index = 1) is programmed with a design that has 1 VIO core(s).
WARNING: [Labtools 27-1347] Unable to find Debug Probes file []. Please update hw_device property [PROBES.FILE]
 Update of hw_probe objects, will be skipped.
WARNING: [Labtools 27-1974] Mismatch between the design programmed into the device xc7z020_1 and the probes file(s) .
The device design has 0 ILA core(s) and 1 VIO core(s). 0 ILA core(s) and 0 VIO core(s) are matched in the probes file(s).
Resolution: 
1. Reprogram device with the correct programming file and associated probes file(s) OR
2. Goto device properties and associate the correct probes file(s) with the programming file already programmed in the device.

These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/smart_light_module_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
