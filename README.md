# SMART-LIGHT
FPGA PROJECT
When we turn ON the switch, depending on the availability of natural light inside the
room, number of LEDs turning on varies and when the switch if OFF, irrespective of
amount of natural light, the light will be OFF. This is realised by using an Ambient
Light Sensor (ALS) together with Zed Board. The DIP switch on Zed Board plays the
role of the switch. When it is ON, Zed Board collects data (amount of natural light)
from sensor and compare it with threshold values to get number of LEDs which
should be ON. If switch is ON depending upon the natural light number of LEDs form
1-8 gets on and when the switch is OFF, the led is OFF.
