These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/smart_light_module_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
